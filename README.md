# The GAP 4 package `GaloisGroups'

An implementation of Fieker and Kl√ºners algorithm to compute galois groups
as described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.3588.pdf

For arithmetic computations it relies on PARI/GP called via the
PARIInterface package.

## Documentation

Full information and documentation can be found in the manual, available
as PDF `doc/manual.pdf` or as HTML `htm/chapters.htm`, or on the package
homepage at

  <http://gap-packages.github.io/GaloisGroups/>

## Testing

Tests are implemented in tst/. To run them do

    $ {GAP} tst/testall.g

## TODO

- given a transitive subgroup G, we need to iterate over all subgroups
  in between Stabilizer(G,1) and G.

- TuplesSetsTuplesSets action (corresponding to permutation action
  on multivariate polynomials)
